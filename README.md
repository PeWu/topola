# Topola – online genealogy visualization

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PeWu/topola.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PeWu/topola)

Topola is a Typescript/Javascript library for embedding genealogy tree visualizations on web pags. The library uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) under the hood for rendering SVG images.

Implemented chart types:
* Ancestors
* Descendants
* Hourglass chart (both ancestors and descendants)
