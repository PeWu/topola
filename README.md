Topola is a Typescript/Javascript library for embedding genealogy tree visualizations on web pags.
The library uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) under the hood for rendering SVG images.

Available chart types:
* Ancestors
* Descendants
* Hourglass chart (both ancestors and descendants)
* Relatives chart (descendants, ancestors and descendants of ancestors), based on the
  [All-in-one report](http://genj.sourceforge.net/wiki/en/reports/graphicaltree) in GenealogyJ
* Fancy chart, inspired by https://imgur.com/a/T02Kc7X
